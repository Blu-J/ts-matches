## [5.0.0] - ??.??.??

Making the description type to convert the parser into something else, like JsonSchema or typescript types. This brings in the names, children, and extras for each.

Adding in optional transformers to bring in to make things like typescript types

```ts
import matches from "ts-matches";
import parserAsTypescriptString from "ts-matches/lib/typescriptTypes";
console.log(parserAsTypescriptString(matches.string)); // string
```

Moving several simple parsers into their own description and parsers. Useful for things like typescript that have primitives like strings, numbers, and booleans.

Changed the tuples to use the style of variadic instead of arrays, needed for typescript inference.

Feat: Make the build include deno first, then compile to mjs and umd

Feature: Bringing in the recursive types
